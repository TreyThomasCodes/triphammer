# The labels Triphammer reads and sets in a project's repository: the owner's brakes and priority, which the owner
# applies, the runner's `agent-working`, and `cleanup`, which the runner puts on the issues it files from a session's
# proposals. `ticket-runner --labels` (which `triphammer add` runs as the service
# user) creates the ones the repository lacks with create_labels, and the doctor reports them with missing_labels, so
# both read this one list. bin/README.md ("Labels") lists what each does. `upkeep` is not here: ticket-runner makes
# sure it exists when it opens an upkeep issue.
#
# Each entry: name|color|description. GitHub limits a description to 100 characters.

# $labelled_jq: a jq prelude defining labelled($name), true when the input's labels include $name, given in lowercase,
# in any case, as GitHub matches label names. It reads both shapes the scripts get: `.labels[].name` (gh --json) and
# `.labels.nodes[].name` (GraphQL). ticket-runner and merge-when-ready prefix their label filters with it:
# --jq "$labelled_jq"'labelled("hold")'. It also defines labels_unread, true when the input's `.labels` (the gh --json
# shape) holds 100 labels or more: gh reads only the first 100 and says nothing of the rest, so a brake may be among them.
# It must stay at 100, the most gh returns. bin/ticket-decide.py's UNREAD is one lower and leaves out agent-working, as
# the runner adds that label before its first brake check: an item picked at 99 would be braked here on every tick.
