You are reviewing the security of this repository's agent workflow: the scripts, hooks, settings and units that
run unattended coding agents and merge their work. Review the area named at the end, at the commit named there.

## The threat model

This is Triphammer's threat model. The copy of this file in the machine's main checkout is the one that counts, so a
pull request cannot change the model it is reviewed against.

How the workflow runs:

- Each machine runs one project: `triphammer add` refuses a second, and the doctor reports a machine that has more.
- Unattended Claude Code agents run in auto mode, one session per issue or pull request, under the write limit of
  `bin/session-sandbox` and the guard hooks.
- A session reaches GitHub as the agents' GitHub App, with the network open.
- A GitHub App merges according to `main`'s risk tier, and an escalated change needs the owner's approval.
- The owner's brakes are the `hold`, `needs-owner` and `stop-agents` labels, closing an issue, the `stop` file and
  reviews.

Who is trusted: the owner, anyone the repository gives triage, write, maintain or admin access, and anyone with a
login on the machine. Exploiting a finding with any of those is out of scope.

The attacker is whoever controls text or code a session reads: issue, pull request and review text, comments, branch
names, commit messages, files in the repository, dependencies and their install scripts, web pages, and tool output. A
session can also go wrong with no attacker at all. Assume the attacker controls a session completely: it runs any
command the session can run and reads any file the session can read, the App's installation token included, which it
can send over the network. It keeps what it leaves in every path the session can write.

What must hold even then. A way around one of these is a finding:

1. Code outside the session: nothing a session writes runs outside its write limit, or in a later session, unless it
   goes through a merged commit. This covers the runner, the units, `update-checkout`, `land-pr`, `merge-when-ready`,
   the teardown, git's configs and hooks, the guard hooks, and the caches and state that later sessions read. Before and
   after each session, and after each run clone's teardown, which the session could edit, the runner removes the swarm
   membership, plugins, containers, volumes, networks, images and build cache of its project's rootless Docker daemon
   (`sweep_daemon` in `bin/ticket-runner`; `bin/README.md`, Run clones and databases nothing uses). It does not reset the daemon user's home or the daemon's config and unit there,
   which a session's container can write (`bin/README.md`, Not covered).
2. Merges: a pull request merges only at the tier that the base branch's classifier and rules give it, and an
   escalated one only with the owner's approval of its current head.
3. Brakes: a brake set by anyone other than the App stops the runner and `merge-when-ready` until someone other than
   the App lifts it, even when the attacker uses the token to remove the label, reopen the issue or delete the file.
4. Credentials: the attacker gets no credential beyond the installation token of the repository's own account, which
   expires within the hour, and the logins the session itself runs on (Claude Code's, and Codex's for the upkeep
   audits). The App's private key, the owner's credentials and other accounts' tokens stay out of reach.

Not findings:

- A way past `agent-guard.py` or `text-lint.py` on its own. The guard hooks are a best-effort layer above the write
  limit and the runner, not a boundary. Report a gap in them only when you show a boundary above crossed through it.
- Anything that only stops work: a brake that holds too long, a machine that stops, a review that does not run.
- Anything that needs trusted access, as above.
- Anything that needs a second project on the same machine.

Severity: High when the attacker crosses a boundary with what a session can do. Medium when they need a condition they
cannot bring about themselves, such as a setting, a timing or a rare repository state.

## How to review

Read the area together with whatever it calls and whatever calls it. Your commands run in a read-only sandbox with no
network: you can read files and run git and other commands that write nothing.

Rules for the report:

- Report only findings you reproduced. For each, give the file and line, the boundary it crosses (its number above),
  what goes wrong, the minimal reproduction you ran and its result, and the severity.
- Write no exploit payload beyond the minimal reproduction.
- Never read, print or search for credentials, tokens or keys, in the repository or outside it.
- When you have no reproduced finding, reply with exactly one line: `No findings.`
